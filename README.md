## How it works

This project defines its own Game Mode `GM_EmbeddedWallet` and Pawn `Pawn_EmbeddedWallet`.
Use them as a starting point to define your own logic.

The pawn uses our built-in [Boilerplates.](https://docs.sequence.xyz/sdk/unreal/bootstrap_game) Feel free
to duplicate them into your project and adjust them to your needs.

## Run the Boilerplate

1. Clone the repository & open the Unreal project
3. Compile the project source code 
4. Download and add your own [Sequence Config](https://docs.sequence.xyz/sdk/unreal/getting_started) from [Builder](https://sequence.build/)
4. Hit Play & Sign In
